# Single-Cycle Processor with DSP Unit (Verilog)

This project implements a **single-cycle CPU architecture** with an integrated DSP unit, designed and simulated using **Xilinx Vivado**.

## Features
- Single-cycle architecture
- ALU implementation
- DSP unit integration
- Data memory, register file, main control, sign extension
- Synthesizable for FPGA deployment

## Project Structure
- `/src` — Verilog source files
- `/tb` — Testbenches
- `/docs` — Project paper & diagrams

## How to Run
1. Open Vivado
2. Create a new RTL project
3. Add the source files from `/src`
4. Run simulation or synthesis

## Documentation
See the full [project paper](docs/Project_Report.pdf) for architecture, implementation, and results.

## Tools Used
- Xilinx Vivado
- Verilog HDL
